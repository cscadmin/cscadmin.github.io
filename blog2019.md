### Back for Autumn / Winter 2019

**Welcome back to all members, old and new**

The club is back into the swing of the new season. We've already had:

  - A really useful teaching session giving an overview of speech preparation techniques
  - 6 wonderful speeches demonstrating how far our members have traveled towards their speaking goals
  - 10+ very entertaining ad-lib topics
  - New joiners getting involved and starting to shine

We're here every 2 weeks until Christmas so do pop down if you'd like to give the club a try.

### 2019 Success

**Lots of Achievements so far in 2019**!

Craven Speakers Club has enjoyed a really strong first half of the year:

  - Lots of new members
  - Members competing at local, _district_ and _national levels_, with a good degree of success
  - Some of us from the club were able to attend the Association of Speaker's Club's _national conference in Edinburgh_
  
Particular credit is due to our _younger members_ who have:

  - Entered open competitions against vastly experienced adults, and won!
  - Used their skills outside of speakers club to achieve success at school
  
We're on a well deserved _summer break_ now but back again on **9th September 2019 - If you are reading this and thinking about joining, we'd be delighted to meet you, come along!**
