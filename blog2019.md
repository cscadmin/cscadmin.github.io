### 2019 Success

**Lots of Achievements so far in 2019**!

Craven Speakers Club has enjoyed a really strong first half of the year:

  - Lots of new members
  - Members competing at local, _district_ and _national levels_, with a good degree of success
  - Some of us from the club were able to attend the Association of Speaker's Club's _national conference in Edinburgh_
  
Particular credit is due to our _younger members_ who have:

  - Entered open competitions against vastly experienced adults, and won!
  - Used their skills outside of speakers club to achieve success at school
  
We're on a well deserved summer break now but back again on 9th September 2019 - **If you are reading this and thinking about joining, we'd be delighted to meet you, come along!**
