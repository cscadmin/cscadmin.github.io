### 2019 Success

**Lots of Achievements so far in 2019**!

Craven Speakers Club has enjoyed a really strong first half of the year:

  -- Lots of new members
  -- Members competing at local, district and national levels, with a good degree of success
  -- Some of us from the club were able to attend the Association of Speaker's Club's national conference in Edinburgh
  
Particular credit is due to our younger members who have:

  -- Entered open competitions against vastly experienced adults, and won!
  -- Used their skills outside of speakers club to achieve success at school
  
We're on a well deserved summer break now but back again on 9th September 2019 - If you are reading this and thinking about joining, we'd be delighted to meet you, come along!
