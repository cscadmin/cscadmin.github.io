<h3 id="how-can-you-become-a-more-effective-speaker-and-gain-confidence">How can you become a more effective speaker and gain confidence?</h3>

<p>Five members of Craven Speakers Club (Skipton) and three of the organisers at Many Hands Craft Centre at Silsden (25 Kirkgate) met on Tue 26 Sept at the Many Hands Shop to discuss this topic</p>

<p>The Speakers demonstrated a shortened version of a typical speakers club meeting, with mini speeches, evaluations, impromptu speaking, discussion and tea-break.</p>

<p>Many Hands run craft workshops (and pampers evenings) and sell craft goods supplied by 12 crafters, and showed the Speakers some of the crafts on display, from mosaics to pottery.</p>

<p>Club President Elaine Davies explained “<em>I first came to Craven Speakers Club out of interest. If you don’t develop, you go backwards!</em>”
Kath Colie of Many Hands said “<em>I’m surprised how much I enjoyed the evening. It is great fun!</em>”</p>

<h3 id="join-in">Join In!</h3>

<p>The next Craven Speakers meeting is at the Soroptimists Rooms, 28 Otley St, Skipton BD23 1EW, Mon 9 Oct 7.45pm, and after that on Mon 23 October when there will be the annual club speech competition</p>

<p>This is a skill members of Craven Speakers Club have fun practising on alternate Monday Evenings in their “Topics section”, at The Soroptimists Rooms, 28, Otley Street, Skipton at 7.45pm</p>

<p>Last Monday 25 Sept <em>Jayaraj Nambian</em> won the Topics Competition, - His topic was “<em>How do you remember to keep good posture</em>?”. <em>Judith Allinson</em> who was the Topics Chairperson was awarded the shield for the evening for the most memorable moment. <em>Elaine Davies</em>, the club president is seen here presenting the trophies. Judith said: “<em>People come to learn to speak more effectively because it helps them in their work and social life</em>.”</p>

<p>The club welcomed three new members at this meeting and would like to see even more people come and make use of this opportunity to gain confidence, learn tips about speaking and have a good night out.</p>

<p>On Monday 9th October Gwendolen Rowe will be giving a talk on “Effective use of notes (for speech making)”. Visitors welcome.</p>
