**Youngest member to represent Skipton club at Dales speakers competition at Baildon**!

Abhay (14), The youngest member at Craven Speakers Club, Skipton, won the club speech competition on 22 October, so will be representing
the club in the Yorkshire Dales Area Speech Competition at Baildon Old Hall at 1pm on Saturday 8th December, when 5 clubs compete.
Sylvia will be representing the club in the Evaluation Competition section.

Two other new members of the Speakers Club also attend Ermysteds Grammar School (as well as Abhay). These two enjoy the Speakers Club activities 
so much they have started their own club at school, which meets on Tuesday lunch times. They say, “We came to Craven Speakers Club as it sounded 
like an excellent opportunity to improve our confidence and skills. And this is exactly what we got, the feedback is extremely helpful and helps 
us within school when talking to the class or giving presentations.”

### How can you become a more effective speaker and gain confidence?

Five members of Craven Speakers Club (Skipton) and three of the organisers at Many Hands Craft Centre at Silsden (25 Kirkgate) met on Tue 26 Sept at the Many Hands Shop to discuss this topic

The Speakers demonstrated a shortened version of a typical speakers club meeting, with mini speeches, evaluations, impromptu speaking, discussion and tea-break.

Many Hands run craft workshops (and pampers evenings) and sell craft goods supplied by 12 crafters, and showed the Speakers some of the crafts on display, from mosaics to pottery.

Club President Elaine explained "_I first came to Craven Speakers Club out of interest. If you don't develop, you go backwards!_"
Kath of Many Hands said "_I'm surprised how much I enjoyed the evening. It is great fun!_"

### Join In!

The next Craven Speakers meeting is at the Soroptimists Rooms, 28 Otley St, Skipton BD23 1EW, Mon 9 Oct 7.45pm, and after that on Mon 23 October when there will be the annual club speech competition
