## ! Coronavirus Update !

<span style="color:red;">
Due to the current **Coronavirus** situation, we have moved to having a **free** monthly **online** meeting (using the Zoom app) during 2020 and early 2021 - timetable [here](/events.html). *New members are very welcome at these  sessions, please get in [contact](/contact.html) to obtain instructions for joining us online*. We are very keen to get back to meeting in person later in 2021, but we have decided to put everyone's health first at the moment.
