## ! Coronavirus Update !

Due to the current **Coronavirus** situation, we have moved our meetings to be **online** only (using the Zoom app) during 2020. **New members are very welcome welcome to join in** and we would love to welcome you to a meeting, please get in [contact](/contact.html) to obtain instructions for joining online. We are very keen to get back to meeting in person in 2021, but we have decided put everyone's health first at the moment.
