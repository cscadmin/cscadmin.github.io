### How can you become a more effective speaker and gain confidence?

Five members of Craven Speakers Club (Skipton) and three of the organisers at Many Hands Craft Centre at Silsden (25 Kirkgate) met on Tue 26 Sept at the Many Hands Shop to discuss this topic

The Speakers demonstrated a shortened version of a typical speakers club meeting, with mini speeches, evaluations, impromptu speaking, discussion and tea-break.

Many Hands run craft workshops (and pampers evenings) and sell craft goods supplied by 12 crafters, and showed the Speakers some of the crafts on display, from mosaics to pottery.

Club President Elaine Davies explained "_I first came to Craven Speakers Club out of interest. If you don't develop, you go backwards!_"
Kath Colie of Many Hands said "_I'm surprised how much I enjoyed the evening. It is great fun!_"

### Join In!

The next Craven Speakers meeting is at the Soroptimists Rooms, 28 Otley St, Skipton BD23 1EW, Mon 9 Oct 7.45pm, and after that on Mon 23 October when there will be the annual club speech competition

### Can you speak to an audience for two minutes on a surprise subject?

This is a skill members of Craven Speakers Club have fun practising on alternate Monday Evenings in their "Topics section", at The Soroptimists Rooms, 28, Otley Street, Skipton at 7.45pm

Last Monday 25 Sept _Jayaraj Nambian_ won the Topics Competition, - His topic was "_How do you remember to keep good posture_?". _Judith Allinson_ who was the Topics Chairperson was awarded the shield for the evening for the most memorable moment. _Elaine Davies_, the club president is seen here presenting the trophies. Judith said: "_People come to learn to speak more effectively because it helps them in their work and social life_."
