## ! Coronavirus Update !

Due to the current **Coronavirus** situation, we have moved our meetings to be **online** only (using the Zoom app) during 2020. *New members are very welcome at these  sessions, please get in contact to obtain instructions for joining us online*. We are very keen to get back to meeting in person in 2021, but we have decided put everyone's health first at the moment. **The information below re joining us in person at The Soroptimist's Rooms for a physical meeting is not currently relevant until we review the Coronavirus situation in 2021**.
